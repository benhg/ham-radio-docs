## starting thoughts:

- For an  HF antenna, let's start with a simple dipole. a. 5m dipole is 1/2 wave for 10m band and 1/4 wave for 20m band.
   -  I am going  to use an off the shelf balun to start. And 12 gauge wire. For the end feeds, we need some PVC. Parts list:
   -  12 gauge wire
   -  Circles of PVC for insulators
   -  Some rope or something to fasten
   -  electrical tape
- For VHF/UHF, I think we can build a log-periodic antenna for say 100-500 MHz.
